## Overview
Data is a fuel on which an organization depends on its operations/running, in other words, data is foundational to organisational operations. Data catalog are central to managing and utilizing data
assets. Data catalog provides an ability to search "for data", based on - name of the data assets,
its metadata plus related business terms. Hence, data catalog plays a critical role in "data discovery". However, most 
of the data catalog rely on "string matching" (using Lucene or Elastic search). These type of search,
lacks in understanding meaning and relationships of concepts in the catalogs. This leads to, missing
useful search hits on the data assets. With the rise of "Data Mesh", which proposes, data products (composition of data assets) are organized in "domains". 
This also poses another search challenge in a data catalog. 

So,how can we address this? Let's throw, the latest buzzwords - ChatGPT, LLM etc - potentially they can and will.

_However_ - I do believe, Data Catalog should be **_"Semantic Data Catalog"_**. In this blog, let's explore - **_"Semantic Data Catalog"_**.

## Semantic Data Catalog

A semantic search engine is based on _**semantic context**_ of _search queries_ and context is more desirable, to understand 
the meaning/knowledge. Semantic _search engines also uses the relationships between entities for returning search results_. This type
of search is based on **_"Knowledge Graph"_**. The Knowledge Graph is a semantic database in which information is 
structured in such a way that knowledge is created from the information. Here, entities (nodes) are related to each other 
via edges, provided with attributes and other information and placed in thematic context or ontologies.Entities are the 
central organizational element in semantic databases, such as Googleâ€™s Knowledge Graph.In addition to the relationships 
between the entities, Google uses data mining to collect attributes and other information about the entities and 
organizes them around the entities, as shown below:

The _**Semantic Data Catalog**_ addresses the challenges mentioned, in the overview section, **_by leveraging, the power of
ontologies, ontology embeddings and vector search to improve data discovery and management_**. _**A Data Catalog is a
social graph**_; hence plain search dos not help, knowledge graph driven based on ontology addresses this challenge.

**_The Semantic Data Catalog_** brings, following benefits: .
1. **Increase search accuracy and relevance**
    Build ontology based knowledge graph, which helps in understanding the meanings of _concepts_ and the _relationships_ 
    between them, a semantic data catalog provides  accurate and relevant search results. This can be measured using:
        - Recall 
        - Precision
       
       ![recall & precession](recall_precession.png)
        
        NOTE: excessive metadata can have negative affect on search, as articulated by [Zipf Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law)

2. **Smarter data governance**
    With toolset like ontology driven knowledge graph, fueling deeper & clear understanding of the meanings as well as
    relationship of data concepts, _**a semantic data catalog provides an organization a tool to better manage and utilize
    their data._**
3. **Increased efficiency and productivity**
   Semantic data catalog makes "search for data" easier, leading towards "searching in data" (lakehouse). it not only
   increase productivity, as well as, efficiency

## Semantic Data Catalog Architecture
1. **Step 1** The starting point is the **_ontology catalog_**, which stores ontology of each of the data assets.
2. **Step 2** Train an ontology embedding model on the catalog to generate numerical vectors, or embeddings, that 
              capture the knowledge/meanings and relationships of concept
3. **Step 3** Load embedding into a vector search engine, which allows users to search for data assets within the
              data catalog using textual queries.
4. **Step 4** A provided query, the model is used to embed query and use vector search engine to fetch the most
              relevant concepts

## Sample Ontology Graph
   For this blog, I will be us pizza owl from [Protege Stanford](https://protege.stanford.edu/ontologies/pizza/pizza.owl)

## Search 
In this blog, I will be using [Facebooks similarity based search package](https://faiss.ai)

## Model & Embedding
In this blog, I will be using [OWL2Vec2 - embedding of OWN ontology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14654)

**NOTE**
1. The embedding produced is affected by the language model and ontology configurations (so it's recommended to expriment
    with embeddings)
2. Accuracy testing is not coverned. It's recommended to use - [MRR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank),
   [Hit Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_rate) (recall & precession)

## OUTPUT
The example provided following search examples as a demonstration:
NOTE: There is no limitation, please enter the query of your choice

```
query  = 'margherita and onion'
# query  = 'margherita'
# query  = 'mozzarella'
query  = 'onion'
# query = 'spicy'
# query  = 'onion'
# query  = 'spicy'
```
Below is the output:

## Summary
Semantic Data Catalog is the future and provide powerful capabilities to simplify data governance challleges of 
discoverability and increase efficiencies. Howeer, it is worth articulating challenges which need to be considered before 
taking it to production:
1. The outcome is dependent on the training of ontology model as well as maintaining its accuracy
2. The continuous evaluation of effectiveness of the embeddings and also updating the search indexes (vectors), as 
   the catalog is evolving
